# Search-Engine
In this project I use JavaScript and Json to import information from Algolia API to HTML.
First , I use a picture from the outer space in the background to illustrate the infinity of a search engine.
I'm use boostrap link to make the site responsive to mobile.
I created in the HTML an input to get value for search and ul for links.
In the style I give to the ul with the links overflow On the Y-axis.
In the JS I create an event o×ž the input that first check if I clicked on the Enter key and if yes 
the value in the input save in variable and brings out all the links from the Algolia API and 
translates it from Json to JavaScript.
In the end I passes in a loop on the array with the information and takes out from there the url links 
depending on the input's value and and put all in list the print that in the ul in HTML.

I really enjoyed working on the challenging project for the first time with JSon, Which at first was very not easy to extract information from.
